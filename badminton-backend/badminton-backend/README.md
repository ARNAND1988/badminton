Backend standalone repository

This folder contains the Flask backend and is designed to be usable as an independent repository.

If you split this folder into its own repository, ensure the following are included:
- `app/` (Flask app code)
- `wsgi.py`
- `requirements.txt`
- `Dockerfile`
- `alembic/` and `alembic.ini` (optional for migrations)

See top-level README for details on environment variables, running, and testing.
